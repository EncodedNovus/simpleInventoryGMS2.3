I haven't used game maker much at all since gm6-8.1, but since it's free I decided to download it and I made an inventory from scratch using GML. It took me a few hours over a few days as I jumped straight into it, but using the documentation and a few old forum posts I just finished it. I've always been stumped by how inventories would work, but I've only used game maker as a hobby when I was a kid, so I never spent the time to learn exactly how GML works. Could I get some pointers on how to improve it? I know there's some ways with ds_lists(?), but I haven't used them before.

Here's a list of what the project contains:

*inventory slots(sprite/object)

*items(3 sprites/objects)

*a parent object

*drag n drop

*stackable--in inventory slot or on the ground if you drag an item of the same type into each other

*can switch them out from an occupied slot with another item

*shows quantity/description(description if you're hovering over it in the inventory)
